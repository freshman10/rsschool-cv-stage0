####Briefly About Myself:

I'm the one who love coding, travelling and learning new things. I have over 10 years experience in poker. Fan of volleyball, hiking and motorbike riding. I'm going to become a senior full stack developer in the next 3 years, to change living location(i prefer a warm weather and sea nearby) and to continue exploring this amazing planet. There are three my strongest sides : logical thinking, open mind and communicating skills.

####Code example: [Human Readable Time](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52685f7382004e774f0001f7)

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

```
def make_readable(seconds):
    hh = seconds // 3600
    mm = (seconds % 3600) // 60
    ss = seconds % 60
    return "{:02}:{:02}:{:02}".format(hh,mm,ss)
```
